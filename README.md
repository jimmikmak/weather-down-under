# Weather-Down-Under

## Description

A weather app for Australia and the World! Made using React, Material UI and Ruby on Rails. Weather data provided by OpenWeatherMap API. 

Easily get the weather conditions and forecast for capitals around the world.

It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system.

```zsh

```

Use yarn to run the client side of the application.

```zsh

```
Install Ruby Rails to run rails server for the backend(in some cases, you will also need to install Ruby).

To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:

```zsh
gem install rails
```
To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:

```zsh
rails --version
```

Starting up the web server: 

```zsh

Although the application is currently working, it lacks user register  functionality and does not yet call a multi-day weather forecast.
